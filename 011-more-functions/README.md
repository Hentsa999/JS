# My thoughts on devtools!

I am using devtools because I want to be able to fully learn javascript, altough It`s really tough, I want to keep trying and to slowly improve myself.
Using devtools has showed me quite a lot I didnt know you can do with google chrome, it is confusing but I want to keep learning how to use devtools for coding.
