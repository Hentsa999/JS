## What I learned about JSON

I learned that JSON is used to trasnfer data to the web applications, it also can be used independently without JavaScript. With a JSON structure it seems like it sets a format for your data for an example, "Name" : "Hentsa Arefaine" it constructs the data.
I am starting to understand it slightly but still have trouble finding certain errors and issues but I am understanding more than I did in the beginning of this course
