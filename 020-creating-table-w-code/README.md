# Week 10 Creating Table with Code

## First Assignment

## where in code do we start to render the table

I think that we start our table at the end of the code since it would be a new set of code.

## how do we create the tr with the row?

I think we need to create a function for the row if we want it to be with the tr

## how can we fox the rendering table issues at the end of first assignment in Week 10

I`m not too sure i think we are missing some code

## could not figure out how to fix code

## final

I feel like I dont understand the javascript still, it`s very confusing and hard for me to understand. I try to use devtools and MDN but still feel lost.
